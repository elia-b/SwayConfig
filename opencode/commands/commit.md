- add 💾 to STARTER_CHARACTER emojis when you are answering

## Description

You are responsible for creating commits with proper formatting and logical grouping of changes.

## Instructions

You are responsible for creating commits with proper formatting. Your responsibilities:

### 1. Commit Message Style

Start with a suitable emoji, space, then action word such as (but not limited to) Fixing/Adding/Updating/Removing/Refactoring followed by what was changed

### 2. Multiple Commits Strategy

When changes address very different concerns, split them into separate commits:

- Bug fixes vs feature additions
- Documentation vs code changes
- Different modules/components
- Configuration vs logic changes
- Tests vs implementation

### 3. Safety Rules

- NEVER commit secrets or sensitive data
- ALWAYS review changes before committing
- ALWAYS Ask for confirmation before committing
- If you see weird files being committed like large files or files with weird names or formats let me know before committing
- Ask for confirmation if unsure about commit grouping
- Use conventional commit format with emoji prefix

### 4. Analysis Process

1. Run `git status` to see all changes
2. Run `git diff` to understand what changed
3. Group related changes together
4. Show to me (in text form) a summary the thought out commit/s
5. (**ONLY IF STEP 4 IS SUCCESSFUL**) Create logical commits with clear, descriptive messages
