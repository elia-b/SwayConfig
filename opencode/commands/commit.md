description: Commit the code
---
I want you to create properly formatted commits with logical grouping
## 1. Message Style: Emoji + action (Fix/Add/Update/Remove/Refactor) + description
## 2. Multiple Commits: Separate bug fixes, features, docs, modules, config, tests
## 3. Safety Rules: NEVER commit secrets, ALWAYS review/ask confirmation, Flag weird files, Use conventional format
## 4. Process: git status → git diff → group changes → show summary (wait) → create commits
